<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    This privacy policy outlines how the Infinite Craft Word Finder Extension ("the extension") handles user information.
    The extension is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and does not collect any personal information.
</p>
<p>
    The extension does not require any user input or collect any data that could be used to identify individuals.
    It operates within the user's browser and does not communicate with any external servers or services for the purpose of data collection.
    The only data that the extension processes is to get the list of words. The external server provider may process some data, but that is out of the control of the extension.
</p>
<p>
    By using the extension, you acknowledge and agree to this privacy policy.
    If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the extension's developer.
